# STM32 CubeMX Makefile based project advanced Build System

This system Based on the Zephyr Project Build system files. The system allow you to assembly autogenerated projects based on makefile, add your code and build.
Benefits that it all works under VSdode Studio and has perfwct Menuconfig functionality that make your project more flexible and independent.



## Features

- CMake Based build system
- Present awesome Menuconfig feature
- Manual and Makefile-configured build
- Cross platform


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  $git clone repo
```
```bash
  $cd repo
```
```bash
  $./env_setup.sh
```
```bash
  $code .
```


## Usage/Examples

- Create inital project in CubeMX and setup all hardware that should be initiated before run your applecation code.
- Save project inside of root directory (as it was done in examples)
- Setup CubeMX code generatot to generate makefile-based project
- Generate code and clothe CubeMX
```
Then you have to override default task code to exclude dependancy of your code
and Cube Genetared project sources

void StartDefaultTask(void const * argument)
{
  /* init code for USB_DEVICE */
  MX_USB_DEVICE_Init();
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 5 */
  /* Infinite loop */
  for(;;)
  {
    extern void userCoreInit(void);
    userCoreInit();
    osThreadSuspend(NULL);
  }
  /* USER CODE END 5 */
}
```
The paradigma for the CMake-based projects is to avoid GLOBE usage, and the best way is to folow example and add sample CMakeLists.txt file to each directory and include all sources here. It provide you a make exlude build. For example to exclude some file from builb by settings in menuconfig.
